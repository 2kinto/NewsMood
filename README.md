# NewsMood
New Mood is an IOS application that AI predicts news content. It introduced a pre-trained text classification model to predict news sentiment through CoreML.
## Motivation
This project is my first IOS development and I hope to run the model I trained on IOS devices.

## Usage
This project used CoreAI, and the IOS version must be above IOS12.

####  AI Model
The corpus for AI model training comes from Twitter and only supports English content.
